However, if you want to play the game without having to insert the CD every time, you will need a no-CD crack. A no-CD crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the CD check. This way, you can run the game from your hard drive or a virtual drive without any hassle.
 
There are different versions of no-CD cracks available for Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault, depending on which patch you have installed. The game was released in 2004 and received several updates that fixed bugs and added features. The latest patch is version 1.2, which was released in 2005.
 
To find out which patch you have, you can check the version number on the main menu of the game. If you have version 1.0 or 1.1, you will need to download and install the patch 1.2 first. You can find it on various websites, such as [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/games/medal-of-honor-pacific-assault/downloads/mohpa-patch-10-to-12).
 
Once you have patched your game to version 1.2, you can download a no-CD crack that matches your game version. You can find them on websites that offer game fixes, such as [GameCopyWorld](https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_medal_of_honor_pacific_assault.shtml) or [GameBurnWorld](http://gameburnworld.com/gp/gamefixes/medalofhonorpacificassault.shtml). Make sure you download the file that says "No-CD/Fixed EXE" or "Fixed Image".
 
After downloading the no-CD crack, you will need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a file with the same name as the original game executable, which is usually "mohpa.exe". You will need to copy this file and paste it into the folder where you installed the game, usually "C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\Medal of Honor Pacific Assault". You will be asked to overwrite the existing file, so make sure you back it up first in case something goes wrong.
 
Now you can launch the game from the no-CD crack and enjoy playing without a CD. However, be aware that using a no-CD crack may prevent you from playing online or accessing some features of the game. Also, some antivirus programs may detect the no-CD crack as a virus or a trojan, so you may need to disable them or add an exception for the file.
 
I hope this helps you play Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault without a CD. Have fun!
